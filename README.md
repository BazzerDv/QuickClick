# Quick Click
Incremental game inspired by [Clicker game](https://www.tetralark.com/ClickerJs/)

A clicker game created by a secondary school student (me) to learn HTML and Javascript. The aim of the game is to get the fastest run possible! New features added regularly (every couple of days if possible). Leave ideas for the game in the discussions section &#128522;.

You can play the game here:
